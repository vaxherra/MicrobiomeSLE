It includes all analysis scripts, anonymised metadata files, and downstream analysis results: core diversity analysis qiime output that could be easily viewed through "index.html" in appropriate folde, also .spf and .txt profiles for taxonomy and metagenome exploration (KEGG orthologs, modules and pathways), that could be easily loaded into any statistical software package, like "STAMP" used for this analysis.
